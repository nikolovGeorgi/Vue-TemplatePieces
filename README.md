# Vue Templates

### Reusable Vue Instances

---

#### How run the app:

1. `npm run serve`
2. `bash start.sh`
3. Move the start.sh file to your path (ex: /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin), or export to your path by adding current directory, then run the file as a stand alone: `start.sh`

#### Reusable components plug & play:

1. Pick a component to test from ./src/components
2. Import the chosen component in App.vue
   - Example given with Home.vue
3. Once app is running, check localhost:8080
4. Rinse & Repeat
