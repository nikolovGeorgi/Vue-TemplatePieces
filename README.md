# Vue Templates

### Reusable Vue Instances

---

#### How run the app:

1. `npm run serve`
2. `bash start.sh`
3. Move the start.sh file to your path (ex: /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin), or export to your path by adding current directory, then run the file as a stand alone: `start.sh`

#### Reusable components plug & play:

1. Once app is running, check localhost:8080
2. Components are listed under categories, such as: Cards or Forms.
3. Choose a category, and all components in it will be displayed for preview.
4. Each component has its name shown as well. The corresponding files can be located in /src/components/< category >
